## AEM Start Page

![aem_start](assets/aem_start.png)

Once we have login into the server (by default `admin:admin`), we are going to see the main menu.

From here we can access almost every thing from the CMS.

We have some links to `Projects`, `Sites`, `Assets` etc. And a toolbar to the left. If we click the hammer button (Tools), we can access some other features like the `CRXDE Lite`, the `Tagging` system, `Templates` manager, etc.
